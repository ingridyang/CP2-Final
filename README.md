# CP2-Final

I combined from the p5.js editor example files: "SoundClassifcation_speechcommand" and "SketchRNN_interactive" to create a speech command drawing generator. The drawings were taking from Google's Sketch Me! and the speech commands were recorded through Teachable Machine (https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/).
