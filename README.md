# CP2-Speech Command Drawing

I combined from the p5.js editor example files: "SoundClassifcation_speechcommand" and "SketchRNN_interactive" to create a speech command drawing generator. The drawings that the code draws are from Google's Sketch Me! and the speech commands of the categories (ie: dog or cat) were recorded through Teachable Machine (https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/).
